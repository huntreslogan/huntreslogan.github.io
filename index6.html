				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2><br>
				<strong><p>As you may be aware, recently enacted federal privacy laws require that I explain each year how "nonpublic personal information" is handled.   This includes (1) information you provide orally or on applications or other forms, and (2) information developed about you in the course of providing services to you, such as the amount and type of your assets that are managed and transactions placed on your behalf.  Note that every possible physical, electronic, and procedural safeguard is maintained to guard your nonpublic personal information.<br>
				As a general rule, this private information is not disclosed to others.  As you might imagine, however, it is necessary to rely on certain third parties, to provide services to you.  Currently this includes custodians who, in the ordinary course of providing their services, may require access to information containing your nonpublic personal information.  In addition, your nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to others with your consent e.g. to your professional advisors, or where required by law or judicial process (such as a court order), or otherwise to the extent permitted under the federal privacy laws.
