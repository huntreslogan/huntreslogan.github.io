				<strong><p>Investment portfolios are personalized to meet each client's'specific objectives. We first determine your risk tolerance, investment time horizon, liquidity requirements and tax situation. In our security selection we try to identify long term global trends and invest in assets that are most likely to appreciate as these trends unfold. Software will be used to model various asset combinations to determine a long-term Strategic Asset Allocation target. Then, utilizing Tactical Asset Allocation periodic changes will be made to manage risk in the portfolio in response to the short term influences of economic, political, and financial cycles.</p>
				<p>Investment management accounts are reviewed daily for transaction activity and at least weekly for performance benchmarking. Clients receive quarterly statements tracking their portfolio performanc and a comparison to the appropriate industry benchmark indicies.</p>
				<p>Financial Plans are updated on an "as needs" basis, when there has been a significant change in a client's life circumstances or the investment climate. Major life changes often require a reassessment of one's personal finances and goals and updating of their plan, for example: marriage, a new job, and approaching retirement.</p></strong>
